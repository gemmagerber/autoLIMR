Description: Ecosystems are often modelled as complex food web networks with 
    inherent input data uncertainties. Increasingly popular techniques of 
    incorporating data uncertainties in food web networks are applying linear 
    inverse modelling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (LIM-MCMC) to calculate 
    multiple plausible representations of the food web within ecological 
    constraints. However, the practical application of LIM-MCMC is restricted 
    by difficulty in coding input files, solving multiple plausible networks, 
    and evaluating model quality. To address these restrictions, we present R
    package 'autoLIMR': an open-source automated workflow using LIM-MCMC to 
    incorporate data uncertainty in food web networks. The main objectives 
    are to improve the accessibility of LIM-MCMC to incorporate data 
    uncertainties and to provide a consistent framework to enhance model 
    output reporting and reproducibility.
