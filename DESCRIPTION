Description: Using linear inverse modelling (LIM) via R
    packages LIM and limSolve are a great way to calculate 
    multiple plausible network solutions. These packages 
    require network data to be coded into "LIM Declaration 
    Files", which can be be tedious and difficult to 
    manually code. autoLIMR provides an automated translation
    from network data (in .xlsx format) to LIM declaration 
    files compatible with LIM and limSolve. autoLIMR 
    provides the option to translate multiple network 
    datasets into multiple LIM Declaration Files at once.
